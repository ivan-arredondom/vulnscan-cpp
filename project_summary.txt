🛡️ Project Title: Static Analyzer for C/C++ Security Vulnerabilities
📌 Summary:
This project aims to build a lightweight static analysis tool that scans C and C++ codebases for common security vulnerabilities. The tool parses source code using Clang tooling to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and applies rule-based detection to identify unsafe coding patterns. It also performs basic data flow tracking to detect issues like tainted input propagation and unsafe memory access.

🔍 Features:
Detection of security flaws such as:

Buffer overflows

Use-after-free

Format string vulnerabilities

Dangerous functions (gets(), strcpy(), etc.)

AST-based parsing with Clang for accurate code structure analysis

Rule engine to flag patterns and functions associated with insecure behavior

Basic data flow tracking to catch risky variable usage

CLI-based interface for scanning .c or .cpp files

Outputs detailed results with file name, line number, vulnerability type, and suggestions

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Language: Python or C++

Libraries: libclang (via clang.cindex if using Python) or Clang LibTooling

Format: JSON or Markdown for output reports

Testing: Use open-source vulnerable C/C++ code or crafted examples

🧪 Usage:
Point the tool to a source file or folder

It scans each file and reports potential security vulnerabilities based on predefined rules

Results are saved to a report file or printed to the console

✅ Deliverables:
Source code for the scanner

Sample vulnerable files and test cases

Example report showing detected issues

Documentation on how to run and extend the tool
